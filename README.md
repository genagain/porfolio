Portfolio
======

Built with [biggie](https://github.com/baptistebriel/biggie "biggie framework by baptiste briel"), a JavaScript application boilerplate based on [bigwheel](https://github.com/bigwheel-framework), a lightweight framework from [Jam3](http://www.jam3.com/).

## Getting Started

> :exclamation: [biggie](https://github.com/baptistebriel/biggie "biggie framework by baptiste briel") uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/ "yarn") for dependency management, so if you have not used yarn before, you need to install it globally before getting started: `npm install -g yarn`

```sh
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/genagain/portfolio.git

# move into project directory
cd portfolio

# install dependencies
yarn

# start gulp
gulp
```
